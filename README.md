## Severity

**Impact:**
Low, as it will not lead to the loss of funds or restrict the functionality of contract

**Likelihood:**
Low, as it happens only for the case of removing battery

## Description

The method `activateBattery` when disabling a previously added `microgridBatteryNFTContracts` (`allocPoints == 0`), does not remove it from the array `batteryInfo.ownedBatteries`. 
Therefore, the method `getBatteryListByUser` will always return a complete list of all user's `microgridBatteryNFTContracts` (with `allocPoints == 0` and `allocPoints > 0`).

## Recommendations

Add logic that removes inactive `microgridBatteryNFTContracts` from the array (using OpenZeppelinâ€™s EnumerableSet is also possible).
